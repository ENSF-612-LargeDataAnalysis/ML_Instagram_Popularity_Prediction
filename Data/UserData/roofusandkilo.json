So, a rundown...\n*Myself and everything else in the house is covered in a teeny tiny layer of snot from Angus, yay. He is doing great and has another balloon procedure tomorrow. Having a very strange tooth setup in his mouth does not stop him from chewing every single thing. I am his personal pacifier (and slave to all creatures) but at least he is potty trained üôå\n*Roofus is doing good, pain still totally managed. He spends his life these days demanding food 99.9% of his waking hours.\n*Casserole is the happiest girl in the whole world and loves everyone and all the dogs but still wants her own space at the end of the day (relatable).\n*Moo is still pushing giant boulders around the yard. Yup.\n*Kilo has discovered that Angus is a really fun playmate and that Roo needs extra cuddles so he's taken to sharing his bed at nap time (so long as it's not windy because wind is scary and he has to sit that out under the bed üôÑ)\n*Penny is playing with a foster pup for the first time since Vinny, but on her own terms i.e. leave me completely alone unless I initiate it k thx\n*Dooders still runs the show. I've put her on a small diet so I'm sleeping with one eye open just in case. She still stalks me constantly but since it has pretty much been a non stop torrential downpour the last 3 weeks she doesn't have far to creep.\n*Tina and Mabel are enjoying demanding grain from me from the luxury of their new beautiful grass filled pasture.\n* Our 20 chicken and 2 duck friends are also completely happy living a ridiculously posh feathered life in a coop area that is always growing until they one day they will probably occupy more space than we do\n* and the humans are hanging in there ü§£. We've taken in another resident, an amazing young lady Mariah, who we love so much and who needed us and our home so it is hers now too.\nI hope your week has treated you well and that you've been able to get more sleep than me!

Dooders has to beat him up a little lately to keep him in line but she's got it handled. He cuddles Moo constantly and loves to play with Cass. Penny steals his toys, Kilo plays with him but isn't in love (he like tiny pups), and Roofus tolerates him like he does all puppies. Speaking of Roo, he is doing so good. We have his pain completely managed for now and his quality of life is wonderful. His cancer is widespread and terminal but we are doing all the things to keep him healthy and comfortable.

I picked him up early yesterday morning after a long 3 month journey getting here.\nQuick recap - In January, @nwdogproject stepped up to provide emergency vet care for a 7 week old puppy that had been kicked in the face (He was surrendered anonymously and all avenues to find who caused this have been explored with unfortunately no luck). His palette, jaw, and skull were all fractured, shattered in some spots. You guys all stepped up (THANK YOU!!!!) so we could commit to him financially as we knew it was a long road ahead. What we didn't expect was a life threatening case of parvo, which then made surgery even more complicated. We almost lost him. He went back and forth between 2 amazing veterinary hospitals in LA where they performed a total of 7 procedures and provided around the clock care. He had a feeding tube for a while since eating with a shattered mouth was difficult. The last surgery he had was the most extensive, trying to repair his nasal cavity so he could breathe. The surgery was a success, although one side of his nose did end up closing again.\nFast forward to today. He is sooo very skinny because of the struggle to eat combined with a huge growth spurt. At 4-5 months old his back legs are the same length as P! I think he is part Great Dane, we will have to do a DNA test to see. But if there's one thing I am good at it's making dogs fat ü§£ so I know he will be looking good in record time. Everything is new and exciting to him now since he has lived most of his puppy life inside of the hospital. All the dogs love him, even Cassie (who is doing amazing ü§ó). Moo is especially interested in him, hovering around and sleeping by him already. Such a good Manny Moo. Angus still struggles a bit to breathe, and sleeps on a toy or his arm so he can rest better. Hopefully as an adult he will be able to have corrective surgery again to fix it completely but compared to where he was a few months ago he's doing pretty good. He is so happy!! And good, and sweet, and loving. He wouldn't be here without @nwdogproject and all of your support so thank you for saving him! We will be fostering him for a while, letting him puppy and just enjoy life ‚ù§Ô∏è", "shortcode": "Bvr3HgRgCmO", "edge_media_to_comment": 462, "comments_disabled": false, "taken_at_timestamp":

quick Roo update too - he is doing well considering. We currently have his pain very well managed with both eastern and western methods. He's on so many different supplements and a ketogenic diet. His appetite is still great! We carry him up and down all stairs, go on daily (slow) walks and car rides, give him all the toys and treats, and spend entire days kissing and loving on him. Nurse Dooders is still taking her role very seriously and pretty much stays glued to his side. This weekend my son is taking him on a special trip to the coast and they will be staying the night in an oceanside room with fireplace courtesy of the INCREDIBLE @livelikeroofoundation. I'm so excited for them both and deeply touched and grateful that @instasarah offered this to them. Absolutely amazing, thank you just isn't enough. He's also received some wonderful gifts in the mail - bully sticks, a cozy blanket, and special treats and cookies. He is loving all of it and we appreciate it more than you can imagine. Love you all, more Roo celebration pictures coming soon.

So Moo occasionally gets into this 2 am poop routine where he of course does his business but then also uses the opportunity to drive me crazy - checking out all the things and making me stand outside in the freezing cold mooing for him for extended amounts of time. I usually break this habit by leashing him, taking away all the fun, but the other night I was really tired and just let him do his thing. 5 minutes goes by and he comes running back, shaking his head and foaming at the mouth. At first I was worried he was bit by something until I caught wind of the WORST smell I have ever encountered in my life. He had been skunked. Yes skunks stink, but fresh, pure, undiluted skunk smells like burning sulfur shoved into your nostrils. It also acts as a tear gas hence the foaming. I'm not sure if it was because I was halfway asleep or what but I stood on the porch with him FOREVER just trying to figure out what to do next. Eventually mom instinct kicked in and hours later we were finally back in bed, but I thought I'd share a few pointers in case this nightmare ever happens to you -\n* Don't bring them in the house!! Our first thought is to put them in the tub but you HAVE to get that first layer off outside or else you have a whole other stinky house problem on your hands.\n* if possible leash them up outside near a warm water source. Grab a bucket, some old towels, and GLOVES.\n* Make a mixture of hydrogen peroxide, baking soda, and dish soap. Let it get a foamy and put on the main area sprayed (Moo's nose in our case). Let sit for 5 minutes then grab your buckets.\n* using warm water work in mixture and rinse well. Do this another 50 times (okay maybe 5) then shampoo them the best you can given your zombie like state, frozen body, and multiple water bucket trips.\n* throw away all towels used\n* you'll want them to sleep in another room in a crate to control the death smell. After some sleep (2 hours for me üôÑ) give them a bath inside. Purchase some Skunk Off spray and rename them stinky for the week.

Roofus has advanced stage osteo sarcoma, bone cancer, in his back. It has already metastasized throughout his body which was what the tumor they removed last week was. We cannot do anything to treat it further which leaves him with a very limited amount of time left with us, likely a few months. We obviously are very sad but in a way I am extremely grateful as well. Not only for having him in our lives and the way he has changed our entire world completely, but for this process as well. So often we lose the ones we love suddenly and are left with thoughts of what we could have done differently and regrets of not being able to say goodbye. I feel blessed that we have the comfort of knowing we have done everything we possibly could, that his pain is lessened by the tumor removal, and now we just get to spend every day we have left celebrating and loving him. This all hurts me most as a mother, seeing my son and Roo go through this. But I love that his best friend was a pit bull from the streets of East Oakland that he rescued. That they were able to grow up together, go through the tough stuff together, and come out the other side strong. That their bond is unbreakable and their love is forever. We would do it all over again in a heartbeat. Tomorrow is Miles' birthday (my son) and we will all be here together. That the very best and most important gift given to us every day. Thank you all for the immense amount of love you have shown us. I read every comment and wish I could respond but just please know it doesn't go unnoticed. I have so much love for this community and feel it in return always - it's incredibly special and means everything.
