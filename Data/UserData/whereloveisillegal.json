At that time I scared that marriage is not only about the sum of being husband and wife to society. Another part is physical and emotional attachment as well. So I think to quit that relationship.” Anuj Peter, a 30 year old #gay man from #Nepal, is an activist at the LGBTQI＋ organization in #Kathmandu, #BlueDiamondSociety.  It took him a long time to understand his sexual orientation and to accept himself. Facing the pressures in Nepalese society to marry, Anuj decided to get engaged to a woman, but soon realized “this is not my right to make her life destroy”. After meeting members of the Blue Diamond Society at an unofficial gay club, Anuj started to come out of his shell. He told his story and came out on national television in 2015 and soon decided to work with his community. “My parents were ok with it but they request not to be come were like this in media, we accept what you are but this stay with the family only. Then I start thing of doing my community. And which I thing many gay guys are still hide his sexuality and their relationship. So I start work about marriage equality. Now I work on the issues to the country.”\n//\nRead Anuj Peter's story shared with the #WhereLoveIsIllegal campaign, a platform for #LGBTQI＋ stories of survival, at the link in our profile.

Kingston hopes their story will encourage us all to examine our prejudices so we can move towards a more accepting society. “If we don’t recognize what’s inside of us, each of us, then my story won’t even begin to till the deep-seeded conflict that has been systematically planted within our hearts and minds, and invariably institutionalized within our society. And, if we don’t begin to uproot these intricately woven internal conflicts, then no matter how visible my struggle becomes it will remain outside of you – rather than becoming a call within your heart to fight for the visibility, justice and equality of all people surviving on the margins.”\n//\nRead Kingston’s story shared with the #WhereLoveIsIllegal campaign, a platform for #LGBTI stories of #discrimination and #survival, at the link in our profile.

They were able to escape, however when they reported the assault to the police they were ignored: “I reported to the police and the police was like, ‘Wow. So you're gay?’ You know, instead of them listening to what happened to me, they didn't. But was their head, ‘Okay. It's a gay issue.’ They were like, ‘Alright. So if you are gay, so be it. Then fine.’ My issue was brushed off. They didn't even do any follow ups. They didn't even arrest those who attacked me. So I don't feel safe. I don't feel safe, more times. You need to be doing your things indoors, always.”\n//\nIn #Ghana, only a brave few dare show their face and publicly say they identify as LGBTQI＋, most live in the shadows fearing discrimination, hatred and violence if they lived openly.\n//\nWhere Love is Illegal traveled to Kenya, Mozambique and Ghana with the support of Elton John AIDS Foundation (@ejaf @ejafdn) to continue our work sharing LGBTQI＋ stories of survival and to raise awareness of the impacts of stigma.

You can only do that for so long before something slips, which unfortunately was the case for me.” He moved to the other side of the US with very few belongings, and has been able to find work and live on his own. National statistics estimate that around 40% of homeless youth in the US are LGBTQI＋. “I've been working and living on my own, taking care of myself and trying to use my story to reach people and help those that may be in the same situation I was in a year and a half ago. This is the sad reality for many LGBTQ＋ youth in the US and my goal is to work towards changing that and building a better future for them.”\n//\nRead Landon’s story shared with the #WhereLoveIsIllegal campaign, a platform for #LGBTI stories of #discrimination and #survival, at the link in our profile.

My sexuality has prevented me from getting work, and I have often wondered why people are so mean to me.” Nillam Poudel is a 27 year old activist, model, make-up artist and #transgenderwoman from #Nepal. Growing up, Nillam would always wear women’s clothes, but after being scolded by her father, she would change. Nowadays, she has been accepted by her family, but she lives with a burden to provide for them as best as she can. Nillam moved to Kathmandu in search for work and higher paying jobs, but has been consistently discriminated against by the Nepalese society. “The best thing has been acceptance from family , friends and being able to accept my own identity. The worst aspect has been lack of respect from society. People still use derogative term. I don’t feel bad , I feel bad for their children. If parents are like that, what kind of education will the children get?” Nillam writes, “I woud be lying if I said I am not experiencing depression...I have seen my friends hurt themselves because their families have not accepted them. Many have become alcoholics, while many others have committed suicide.” Although Nillam has deeply struggled from the discrimination she experiences, she has bravely set her goals: “In the future, I want to start a place for LGBTI folks, like an old age home, for people who have been thrown away from their families or home, or those who are old and cannot work.“ She concludes her story by writing: “Those of you who will see this… In 21st century, there is bound to be somebody who is from LGBT community near your community, but they might not be open because of you. When you accept LGBTI people who are already out, it will better your family. Accept everyone.”\n//\nRead Nillam Poudel's story shared with the #WhereLoveIsIllegal campaign, a platform for #LGBTQI＋ stories of survival, at the link in our profile.

Today we honor men and women like Sally who are unable to live openly everyday, but when they can safely are still visible and proud!\n//\n“I ran away from Syria because I was running away from ISIS. One of my family members is now with ISIS. Because of him I ran away here. He was in charge of investigations in ISIS. They want to catch and kill the gays. My last partner was kidnapped and interrogated by ISIS. I’m 90% sure they killed him.  To kill someone they will choose the highest building and push him from it.” Sally fled Syria when ISIS still controlled large parts of the country. She found relative safety in Lebanon. “I was in a society ruled by old Customs and traditions and from another side my society is ruled by religions which strongly refuse my sexuality so I lived wearing the mask of a straight man.”\n//\nRead Sally's story shared with the #WhereLoveIsIllegal campaign, a platform for #LGBT stories of survival, at the link in our profile. At the link you can also see how to share your own experience of #discrimination and #survival and how you can support. Photo by @Hammond_Robin. This is a @witness_change project.
