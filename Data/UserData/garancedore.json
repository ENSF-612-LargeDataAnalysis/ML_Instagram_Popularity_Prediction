It‚Äôs not hard. It‚Äôs pretty easy. The part that‚Äôs hard about it is to make it a practice. To do it everyday. Happy, sad, busy, just sit for a few minutes and do it.\n.\nIt‚Äôs the keeping at it that‚Äôs the challenge, the teaching, and the way.\n.\nThe day @em_note note took that photo, I had fallen off my practice and was trying to get back to it. I had gone from 20 minutes a day back down to a excruciatingly forced five super agitated minutes. Sometimes I could only make it to three and feel so very angry after that I wanted to throw my ü§¨ timer against the wall. Because I thought my timer didn‚Äôt work. Because there was no way one minute could be that long.\n.\nI didn‚Äôt think I had failed. Or that I wasn‚Äôt made for it, or that meditation was new agey trendy stupid annoying bullshit anyway. Well I did, but I let that thought pass üòÇüòÇüòÇ. Then I got back to the commitment I made to myself [at our retreat in Chile] to just keep trying.\n.\nSo right now I am back in a flow. I am so happy to sit, I am so looking forward to it that I actually have to stop myself from wanting to do it 3 times a day. I feel connected to myself and to others and I feel that now familiar spaciousness inside. My meditation is one of the best parts of my day.\n.\nThe meditation hasn‚Äôt changed. I have. I change around it, I change into it. I encounter and struggle and sometimes am able to let go of my resistances. .\n\nAnd maybe tomorrow, for no apparent reason, I‚Äôll go back to thinking this is all crap and I have much better things to do.\n.\nBut each time I sit and breathe, keep honoring my commitment, it becomes easier to find my way back.\n.\n\nSo, this not really a story about meditation. It‚Äôs a story about commitment. For any of the small things or big things we want to achieve. Like art. Like living a healthier life. Like a new way of being. About not giving up, but not hating ourselves when we do, and just picking up and getting back to it, even if just for one excrutiating minute.\n.\n.\n.\nA big hug to my teacher @susan.piver üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è", "shortcode": "BwXCtQdB5ZY", "edge_media_to_comment": 200, "comments_disabled": false, "taken_at_timestamp": 1555511361, "dimensions": {"height": 1350, "width": 1080}, "display_url": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/a85ea843f729b6d1bc4c5fa5684fe55d/5D3E180A/t51.2885-15/e35/57156490_404171490433177_4992855745272060210_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "edge_liked_by": 8654, "edge_media_preview_like": 8654, "location": null, "gating_info": null, "media_preview": "ACEquz36ogkVWZT34HB6HnnB9cVkyaxIfuKF+pJ/wFXbpSbZif4Y1x+Yrmc0Aa1rNLdOfMYlVGdo4B9OnarjwiUFWUEH2/ke1VtEUs0nf5R/M1tRR5Y5HTdQBxWKKKKAO1ulBt2XOcoAB349q5JoHH8Lfka695P3bcFsr0H/ANesb7Ts6gp7lc/1FAE+hIUaQkYyB1+prUUuGY4GDnJ/nWRY3hGIgFcOeMnofr6fhWnwRgqAe+CaAOLwKK6Ty4/7oooApl5YOMsv8v8ACkF4/RgGH5fy/wAK28AjB5FZKKBcgADHp+FAF+2jVD5m0KxH5VZDDJPrUQo70AR4op1FAH//2Q==", "owner": {"id": "12488328", "username": "garancedore"}, "thumbnail_src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/68759ecca2c1c0bd22cdf5648c6a05fc/5D464E49/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.135.1080.1080/s640x640/57156490_404171490433177_4992855745272060210_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "thumbnail_resources": [{"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/916710ca1fb89924c63d326daaa8fe53/5D426352/t51.2885-15/e35/c0.135.1080.1080/s150x150/57156490_404171490433177_4992855745272060210_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 150, "config_height": 150}, {"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/2076aec1fbb6586dc8410696512a2859/5D3FD818/t51.2885-15/e35/c0.135.1080.1080/s240x240/57156490_404171490433177_4992855745272060210_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 240, "config_height": 240}, {"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/50af153c91b3eea86b235ef3d0d811f4/5D71EDA2/t51.2885-15/e35/c0.135.1080.1080/s320x320/57156490_404171490433177_4992855745272060210_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 320, "config_height": 320}, {"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/818a4c576ef99c37f9f97e849e72e96a/5D466EF8/t51.2885-15/e35/c0.135.1080.1080/s480x480/57156490_404171490433177_4992855745272060210_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 480, "config_height": 480}, {"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/68759ecca2c1c0bd22cdf5648c6a05fc/5D464E49/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.135.1080.1080/s640x640/57156490_404171490433177_4992855745272060210_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 640, "config_height": 640}], "is_video": false, "accessibility_caption": "Image may contain: 1 person, indoor"}, {"__typename": "GraphImage", "id": "2022683561060367559", "edge_media_to_caption": "What should I do with my life?\n.\nWas the question I asked myself in my 10s (yes!) and 20s. Funny how we can look so careless on the outside while being freaked out inside...\n.\nThen I followed my dream to be an artist. Trained myself to be an illustrator, embarked on this blog adventure and became a photographer, founded a company + all the things that come with it.\n.\nI travelled a lot, gave conferences, wrote a book, directed tiny shoots with no budget and giant ones with hundreds of people. I experienced and lived quite a sexy life.\n.\nI remember at some point realizing I hadn‚Äôt been more than 10 consecutive days at my home in a year.\n.\nI slowly came to understand that a happy career is not just what we see as the result (being of service, status or money) but it‚Äôs also the EVERYDAY.\n.\nWhat do you love to do everyday?\n.\nI realized directing shoots was very gratifying but that I am way too sensitive for it. The stress of it runs me to the ground. Traveling non stop is great - but I felt so out of balance, lonely - it‚Äôs hard for me to travel & stay grounded in my routines, I‚Äôm too engaged. Running a company is fulfilling but office life is not for me... And I am also way too emotional to be a boss. I can inspire, but it takes a lot out of me to lead. I could do it if I needed to. But at the core, it drains me. So much respect for those who can!\n.\nSo what was left is something a lot of people would find dreadful & isolating but that I LOVE. Working from home, alone. I loved it when I was an illustrator, broke, unknown, just working on my craft, and I still love it today that I am about to write a new book, getting excited to ‚Äúget deep‚Äù.\n.\nI‚Äôm fully in love with my life & in flow when it is rythmic, extremely simple & grounded in rituals.\n.\nWith that base, I can enjoy the rest (traveling, public speaking, even shoots sometimes!!!) as a joyful time, knowing soon I will be back in my balance.\n.\nIf you don‚Äôt know what to do with your life, here is a small clue : figure out what your dream day looks like. If you‚Äôre not sure, experiment. Ask around. Find your personal balance.\n.\nIt is only by embracing who we are that we can find our true mission, our dream life.", "shortcode": "BwSA_tuBnzH", "edge_media_to_comment": 290, "comments_disabled": false, "taken_at_timestamp": 1555342692, "dimensions": {"height": 1350, "width": 1080}, "display_url": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/6aa43481fdf87daf94395058e5a64d66/5D3C8963/t51.2885-15/e35/56458245_278163336456354_3321907640341911998_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "edge_liked_by": 5891, "edge_media_preview_like": 5891, "location": null, "gating_info": null, "media_preview": "ACEq6aiiigAooooAKKKKACkqAW4BY5bLnJ+Y8fT0pfIy25iSSAOvAxzx6ZPX1wBQBPTdwPeo1h287mPJPJz17fT09O1MFsAQcnIzzx1JyT07/wAsYoAs0UUUAFFFFABRRRQAUUUUAf/Z", "owner": {"id": "12488328", "username": "garancedore"}, "thumbnail_src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/5c61a0da440d14e488125946d3c3199c/5D3ABD20/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.135.1080.1080/s640x640/56458245_278163336456354_3321907640341911998_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "thumbnail_resources": [{"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/353d4814ba30ceaea6b81f585e285fd8/5D3A193B/t51.2885-15/e35/c0.135.1080.1080/s150x150/56458245_278163336456354_3321907640341911998_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 150, "config_height": 150}, {"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/36f106e285262f200613806e0a1a86be/5D56F671/t51.2885-15/e35/c0.135.1080.1080/s240x240/56458245_278163336456354_3321907640341911998_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 240, "config_height": 240}, {"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/c8fd72b71b8577d1b293c1f0dfa32f69/5D734BCB/t51.2885-15/e35/c0.135.1080.1080/s320x320/56458245_278163336456354_3321907640341911998_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 320, "config_height": 320}, {"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/667fc4bca99f67356c28f3f6ba2c721c/5D538091/t51.2885-15/e35/c0.135.1080.1080/s480x480/56458245_278163336456354_3321907640341911998_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 480, "config_height": 480}, {"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/5c61a0da440d14e488125946d3c3199c/5D3ABD20/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.135.1080.1080/s640x640/56458245_278163336456354_3321907640341911998_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 640, "config_height": 640}], "is_video": false, "accessibility_caption": "Image may contain: text"}, {"__typename": "GraphImage", "id": "2020502629414902449", "edge_media_to_caption": "First stop when I get home - last stop when I leave home - this is my entryway!

I try to bring the best energy I can. That‚Äôs the me I know.\n.\nAnd suddenly I was this empty shell. Exhausted and depressed and barely there. And quite ashamed of it. \nBut one thing is, I have a very hard time hiding my pain - or my joys. I‚Äôm just quite real most the time... Sometimes to a fault.\n.\nIt scared me. I didn‚Äôt want people to misunderstand me. Think that I was a thoughtless diva. Never hire me and my team again. So I remember sitting down with @caitlinrvillarreal who works with me and is a wonder and a beautiful human and telling her look, I am so so sorry, but here is what‚Äôs happening. I am holding on by a hair. I know I will feel better soon but right now - this is where I am. I wish we could have pushed back this job. But we couldn‚Äôt.\n.\nAs a boss that felt terribly vulnerable. I want to be an inspiration, a person you can count on. Not that fragile weepy woman.\n.\nShe said thank you for telling me. Thank you for trusting me. We got your back.\n.\nI made it through, and we went on and created happy joyful images.\n.\nI can‚Äôt thank the team enough for protecting me and putting a screen of smoke between me and my client.\n.\nAnd now I look at this moment, this image taken between two shots and all I can feel is gratitude. For being surrounded by the most wonderful team. For the highs, the lows, and as it ALWAYS happens, the unexpected arms that open up to catch you as you‚Äôre falling.\n.\n@em_note @caitlinrvillarreal @veromcc @vanessakhoury__", "shortcode": "BwFJT0SBblv", "edge_media_to_comment": 309, "comments_disabled": false, "taken_at_timestamp": 1554910843, "dimensions": {"height": 1253, "width": 1080}, "display_url": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/e5667ff80773c8d6925f68b23e5fd081/5D5349EE/t51.2885-15/e35/54513737_651732945268197_5069301083223887731_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "edge_liked_by": 13641, "edge_media_preview_like": 13641, "location": null, "gating_info": null, "media_preview": "ACQq0Caj3ZprHHU/5+lVLpykZZSVII5/p+NbXOdK5bJpAc0yJvMUPjhhnqKlUUCsAGaKnVgBiigCru596juEEkZB5759cf0qwEH+NNZBjGcZHPuB/nAoGJDHtRVXoB/k1IQF96pSTuoJRSFPJzjr7egPp+VRrcOP9YCAe+Ov+fanYVzQJFFVQ27nn8RRQBcAx/n0qJ2xUzf1/qaqsec/560hiEbiOQQMk98noPwGfw71Gx3DBAAA69cgdR7e2Ohqe5G3GOOO1Ry8x575HNMQ+MMFwvAH0P60UzoB9BRSA//Z", "owner": {"id": "12488328", "username": "garancedore"}, "thumbnail_src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/4c6aa0765c36707656a61b4cf4eb908c/5D33ADEB/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.86.1080.1080/s640x640/54513737_651732945268197_5069301083223887731_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "thumbnail_resources": [{"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/511db3a8b3604ba60f19a32e5efa8f2b/5D3B7583/t51.2885-15/e35/c0.86.1080.1080/s150x150/54513737_651732945268197_5069301083223887731_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 150, "config_height": 150}, {"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/24d042b3a98c9efb963441506ff91f34/5D75A5C9/t51.2885-15/e35/c0.86.1080.1080/s240x240/54513737_651732945268197_5069301083223887731_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 240, "config_height": 240}, {"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/adc33647b42377626fdffed831b93fb2/5D49D973/t51.2885-15/e35/c0.86.1080.1080/s320x320/54513737_651732945268197_5069301083223887731_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 320, "config_height": 320}, {"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/05f3877ab11b55ae97aef3af481824c7/5D474929/t51.2885-15/e35/c0.86.1080.1080/s480x480/54513737_651732945268197_5069301083223887731_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 480, "config_height": 480}, {"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/4c6aa0765c36707656a61b4cf4eb908c/5D33ADEB/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.86.1080.1080/s640x640/54513737_651732945268197_5069301083223887731_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 640, "config_height": 640}], "is_video": false, "accessibility_caption": "Image may contain: one or more people, people standing, swimming, outdoor, water and nature"}, {"__typename": "GraphImage", "id": "2017576250008610146", "edge_media_to_caption": "This weekend I totally, radically got rid of my clothes.

Twisted - shows how expensive things often own us more than we own them...\n.\nBut also clothes that I bought too fast because they were cheap. Low prices often make us feel like it‚Äôs ‚Äúnothing‚Äù: we can buy & think later. We can ‚Äúreturn easy!!!‚Äù - except we never do because the low price doesn‚Äôt incentivize us (a whole industry is built on thoughtless buying - it‚Äôs destroying the planet) - think even if you buy cheap!\n.\nClothes that I love but that carry so much emotional weight. Hard! That jacket I wore  with that man on that date. That dress I wore when I received that award. This bag I bought with my first big paycheck.\n.\nOh, the clothes that ‚Äúwill come back in fashion‚Äù - so what, am I waiting to get old enough that fashion will have made a full cycle & I can wear stuff from 20 years ago ‚Äúhey guys I ACTUALLY SAW DISCO!!!‚Äù üëµüèºü§™üòÇ\n.\nThen there is my essentials - that I wear so much they get old & sad without me seeing it.

For years I just though I was ‚Äúan early riser‚Äù but when I started looking closer, I realized I would be sleeping a five hour night on a regular basis.\n.\nWhen you‚Äôre used to running on empty, you don‚Äôt realize that you are. You get used to having crazy sugar & caffeine cravings (your body needs it to keep moving because it is so exhausted and sugar gives a spike of energy)(hello weight problems!) to have debilitating mood swings (the first thing that lack of sleep impacts is your mental health) and giant crashes where you just sit there and look in the distance like an empty shell. Worse - you can never really rest because your body is in high alert all the time.\n.\nThe stress created by that vicious cycle can make a huge mess in your body. I won‚Äôt go into this here - we know stress is the root of most diseases.\n.\nI remember my sister telling me it was so weird I was not suffering from jet lag. And ‚ÄúHow did I do it?‚Äù\nWell now I know. It‚Äôs not that I was not - it‚Äôs that I had completely lost touch with what it means to FEEL RESTED. I just kept going even if I was losing myself in the process.\n.\nSo, I guess the first thing, if you want to explore your sleep is to ask yourself if you wake up feeling rested. When I am not sleeping well, i wake up with my brain already rushing and planning and solving problems (I used to think that was cool üòÖ). When I have slept well, i wake up not even knowing where I am, in a truly happy haze that take a few lovely minutes to dissipate.\n.\nAll right, tell me if you want to know more, because sleep is a big subject and I am quite passionate.

And, because we‚Äôre not sure what success is but we know we‚Äôre supposed to want it, we often accept the general definition without questioning it.\n.\nIt took me a long time to understand what my definition of success is - and it‚Äôs not making millions. Once I figured that out - and the many other things that came with it, the pressure could slowly let go. .\n\nHappiness is a moment, not a state. We can‚Äôt be continually happy. Happy is like a bird that lands on your shoulder at a moment you weren‚Äôt expecting it. And the second you try to capture it, it goes away.\n.\nThe only thing you can do is create a good home for it and forget about it.\n.\nI am slowly understanding that my sense of happiness comes from a deep feeling of interior peace and connection to my emotions and my needs. When I can feel the big quiet inside, it‚Äôs a sign. It can be alone driving, or surrounded by people - it doesn‚Äôt matter. It can be in moments of total love and beauty or at moments when my life is falling apart. As long as I am allowing and living my emotions, I connect to the quiet - and i make room for happiness.\n.\nUnhappiness is : anytime I deny myself my emotions and my needs. .\n\nBut that‚Äôs just me (and it doesn‚Äôt mean living I‚Äôm living in my bubble and ignoring other people‚Äôs needs üòã)- It takes practice to get to understanding yourself, and discipline to integrate what you know. It‚Äôs a lot of the teachings of our retreats (and why we love them so much) (gaaaaah we‚Äôre working on the next one!!!) - trying to give our guests the tools to understand themselves and their needs and be independant thinkers.\n.\nWho am I kidding üòÇ I am the number one student of our retreats - which is also why I am so passionate about them. As in most things I‚Äôve explored professionally - they stem from my personal quest, and I share along the way. .\n\nI would love to know - what‚Äôs your definition of success? And when do you feel truly happy?", "shortcode": "Bvb0dBcBKBW", "edge_media_to_comment": 112, "comments_disabled": false, "taken_at_timestamp": 1553524177, "dimensions": {"height": 1350, "width": 1080}, "display_url": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/ad762198a7d9ce98969140fd537d36c7/5D310BA0/t51.2885-15/e35/54771052_2060681607563557_7399560831474132165_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "edge_liked_by": 5156, "edge_media_preview_like": 5156, "location": "Palm Springs, California", "gating_info": null, "media_preview": "ACEq6aimO4QZOfwGf5U0SggnnA9j+nHNAEtFQ+dyQQcDocE54z/9YetKJcnbg9cdDj160AS0UUUARSZyBzjvj+vtTNpP98dR279/w6CrFFAEJyD/ABHIxxjAx/U0iA5B+b0O4/5/MVPRQAUUUUAFFFFABRRRQAUUUUAf/9k=", "owner": {"id": "12488328", "username": "garancedore"}, "thumbnail_src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/2adbb987ecd8398ab2e644a5550ebe6f/5D725C38/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.135.1080.1080/s640x640/54771052_2060681607563557_7399560831474132165_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "thumbnail_resources": [{"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/e38cdebb959cfcc0df1cc7713c048d43/5D30A0AF/t51.2885-15/e35/c0.135.1080.1080/s150x150/54771052_2060681607563557_7399560831474132165_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 150, "config_height": 150}, {"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/54f4d54be290f004339e3151baa2aa99/5D429BA9/t51.2885-15/e35/c0.135.1080.1080/s240x240/54771052_2060681607563557_7399560831474132165_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 240, "config_height": 240}, {"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/fc873ba76217b5e645523a75404c083d/5D44B0D7/t51.2885-15/e35/c0.135.1080.1080/s320x320/54771052_2060681607563557_7399560831474132165_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 320, "config_height": 320}, {"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/993fbb449269651b1d11a5fa42712583/5D417590/t51.2885-15/e35/c0.135.1080.1080/s480x480/54771052_2060681607563557_7399560831474132165_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 480, "config_height": 480}, {"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/2adbb987ecd8398ab2e644a5550ebe6f/5D725C38/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.135.1080.1080/s640x640/54771052_2060681607563557_7399560831474132165_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 640, "config_height": 640}], "is_video": false, "accessibility_caption": "Image may contain: text"}, {"__typename": "GraphImage", "id": "2003748170324331632", "edge_media_to_caption": "This is my bedroom!\n.\nSleep has always been a ‚Äúthing‚Äù for me - I fall asleep easily but tend to wake up too early, any sound or light can wake me up. Also my internal clock is way too precise, meaning I deal with stress while I am sleeping (a lot of us are, if you‚Äôre interested I am happy to talk more about it). It‚Äôs not cool. I can come back from a party at 4am and wake up at 6, just because it‚Äôs my usual wake up time üòë - And then be exhausted all day long.\n.\nWhen I went to see my psychiatrist the first thing he asked me was : how do you sleep?\nYes: sleep is the most important factor for our mental health.\n.\nSO - the rule when thinking of a bedroom is to keep in mind that it should be used for two things : sleep & sex (yes and yes!!!). Okay reading is fine ü§ì No working no Game Of Thrones no texting (I mean unless your bedroom is also your office, living, & kitchen aka when I lived in my studio in Paris !) - of course, it‚Äôs hard. I still bring my screens in my bedroom most days. I still wake up to my phone most days. I bought some blue light blocking glasses and never ever wear them. Ah! But I‚Äôm trying -  work in progress.\n.\nI also wanted to room to be a refuge. LA (and my house!) is all about brightness and sunlight, and sometimes you just want to truly chill down. .\nSo I used real black out shades from @theshadestore - painted everything in the Dark night shade from @hgtvhomebysherwinwilliams , and had the sheets dyed by @flaneurnyc (such a cool feature they do!) I wanted a totally monochrome bedroom - @sarahshermansamuel had to stop me: I also wanted to put wall to wall carpet in the same shade. We might still end up doing it! I love a good old fashion carpet üòå\n.\nFor the full house story on @dominomag follow the link in my bio!\n.\nInterior designer : @sarahshermansamuel \nPhotos : @jasonfrankrothenberg \nEditor : @kateberryberry \nStyled by : @thelocationist_ .\nArt: Midget Farrelly Surfing Shore Break, Makaha, 1968, by LeRoy Grannis.
