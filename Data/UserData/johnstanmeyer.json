No, not by people, although it could be given the way we treat each other. It’s something tinier - mosquitos.\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nAnnually, there are roughly 200 million malaria cases, an estimated 400+ thousand malaria deaths worldwide. When an area of the Amazon east of Iquitos had a road asphalted in 2004, a dramatic effect occurred. Deforestation and rapid development, and rates of malaria skyrocketed...when trees are cut, the sun reaches pockets of rain, creating a perfect breeding ground for mosquitoes.\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nAnother killer is ourselves. We continue to tear apart our planet like children fight over candy, exacerbating weather and climate change, taking away the lungs of our earth. We’re living in precarious times where only collectively can we balance an extremely unbalanced world.\n-\nPhoto #1: To do this story properly, I didn’t want to be more privilege than the kind people who allowed me into their lives. As a test, I chose not to take any malaria prevention. Only 2 long sleeve shirts, 2 trousers, a mosquito net and an occasional insect coil.

I was waiting by this flag when a 73-year-old man walked by and I asked him if he could stop for a photograph. He told me he was hurrying to get home, but I convinced him to pose for one frame, which he did. He had lost a lot of his personal belongings and had suffered damages to his home because of the hurricane, he told me. ~ Ruddy Roye\n-\n#printsale #VIIPhoto #VIIArchive #FlashSale #photosale #ruddyroye", "shortcode": "BwKexK3hQSg", "edge_media_to_comment": 12, "comments_disabled": false, "taken_at_timestamp": 1555089866, "dimensions": {"height": 1350, "width": 1080}, "display_url": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/3372cbd59dec0725b32db2dea61ceff0/5D722946/t51.2885-15/e35/56355407_118954505952134_2610763813555781762_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "edge_liked_by": 2805, "edge_media_preview_like": 2805, "location": "Planet Earth", "gating_info": null, "media_preview": null, "owner": {"id": "7686242", "username": "johnstanmeyer"}, "thumbnail_src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/fbf9503a0e79f34764194105af04dd2f/5D3E8005/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.135.1080.1080/s640x640/56355407_118954505952134_2610763813555781762_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "thumbnail_resources": [{"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/4c453470c4b28f49df6dc0c3c65bd8f6/5D3F2E1E/t51.2885-15/e35/c0.135.1080.1080/s150x150/56355407_118954505952134_2610763813555781762_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 150, "config_height": 150}, {"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/d93e7ce9a11ea4f0aa59031ad15b6c28/5D517854/t51.2885-15/e35/c0.135.1080.1080/s240x240/56355407_118954505952134_2610763813555781762_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 240, "config_height": 240}, {"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/fa09692301ca16b490467d6835cd39fb/5D7534EE/t51.2885-15/e35/c0.135.1080.1080/s320x320/56355407_118954505952134_2610763813555781762_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 320, "config_height": 320}, {"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/31f671b92eca947b67f639bf8c7a60af/5D474EB4/t51.2885-15/e35/c0.135.1080.1080/s480x480/56355407_118954505952134_2610763813555781762_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 480, "config_height": 480}, {"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/fbf9503a0e79f34764194105af04dd2f/5D3E8005/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.135.1080.1080/s640x640/56355407_118954505952134_2610763813555781762_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 640, "config_height": 640}], "is_video": false, "accessibility_caption": "Image may contain: one or more people, people standing and outdoor"}, {"__typename": "GraphSidecar", "id": "2020194813588282491", "edge_media_to_caption": "Swipe - Photo 1: One thing you learn in the work I do...in every war, nearly every famine, every form of oppression, there is someone to blame.\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nWhen witnessing the aftereffect of tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes or here, in the madness of the Yogjakarta earthquake in 2006 while on a story for Time magazine, whenever I spoke with people within all this heaviness, after saying they were doing the best they can, thankful they survived, their next response was almost universal, “Who am I to blame, God?”\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nOur earth is alive.

We chose to do this now as a celebration of the expansion of the agency and our continued commitment to telling critical stories worldwide - we have many incredible new members, creating and committed in the deepest levels of visual storytelling.\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nWith a collective archive spanning 40+ years, my colleague and I at VII have dedicated our careers to moments of dignity amidst social upheaval, war, famine, other social concerns and yes at times, beauty. Of the millions of exposures we’ve created, here in this collection are some truly powerful, historical and intensely personal prints that would be wonderful in anyones collection - I’ve chosen on this post a print by the late, great, dearest one, Alexandra Boulat…this image of Alex’s from Iran - “Training building for shooting at the Women's Police Academy of Tehran”, is just one of the prints available. Alexandra was power and brilliance, missing her dearly.\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nFor added insight…each special edition 8”×10” photograph will be hand-signed by the photographer (except for Alex’s…we sadly lost her in 2007). Printed on #Fuji Crystal Archive museum grade C-Type paper at New York City’s top photographic lab, these images are beautifully packed and sleeved in fully archival materials. Each print is embossed with the VII logo and comes with a certificate of authenticity printed on museum grade acid-free paper. The last time we did this a few years ago, I was amazed by the quality of the printing, the care and love put into the packaging of each print I signed. Each individual signed print is only $100, the box set of 29, just $1500.\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nVisit my Instagram Bio and there you will find a direct link to order. Sale is only available from April 11-18, 2019. OH, and there’s an amazing wood boxset of prints available too - and yes, I plan to order that!\n-\n#printsale #VIIPhoto #VIIArchive #FlashSale #photosale #alexandraboulat", "shortcode": "BwIMABJhc33", "edge_media_to_comment": 9, "comments_disabled": false, "taken_at_timestamp": 1555012917, "dimensions": {"height": 1350, "width": 1080}, "display_url": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/710c969b722263be64e8e800f8c4daf0/5D55A995/t51.2885-15/e35/56881493_319629278745325_7824441806103410671_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "edge_liked_by": 2672, "edge_media_preview_like": 2672, "location": "Planet Earth", "gating_info": null, "media_preview": null, "owner": {"id": "7686242", "username": "johnstanmeyer"}, "thumbnail_src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/e8e76661a17f7ae888ed41c20c296c03/5D46D5D6/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.135.1080.1080/s640x640/56881493_319629278745325_7824441806103410671_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "thumbnail_resources": [{"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/9ebdfb64d37598f2c3e7f7f7cedd7c94/5D542BCD/t51.2885-15/e35/c0.135.1080.1080/s150x150/56881493_319629278745325_7824441806103410671_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 150, "config_height": 150}, {"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/e04d6c097f11784e588b5b42607484a3/5D415987/t51.2885-15/e35/c0.135.1080.1080/s240x240/56881493_319629278745325_7824441806103410671_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 240, "config_height": 240}, {"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/2af7e0d6bd8c39cffc6deb92d62f2db0/5D37CC3D/t51.2885-15/e35/c0.135.1080.1080/s320x320/56881493_319629278745325_7824441806103410671_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 320, "config_height": 320}, {"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/4e62449bc5820a9631a2581a0405351b/5D562D67/t51.2885-15/e35/c0.135.1080.1080/s480x480/56881493_319629278745325_7824441806103410671_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 480, "config_height": 480}, {"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/e8e76661a17f7ae888ed41c20c296c03/5D46D5D6/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.135.1080.1080/s640x640/56881493_319629278745325_7824441806103410671_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 640, "config_height": 640}], "is_video": false, "accessibility_caption": "Image may contain: 4 people"}, {"__typename": "GraphSidecar", "id": "2019505085159382025", "edge_media_to_caption": "Swipe - In early 2013 while on the first chapter of the @outofedenwalk for @natgeo, there was an unexpected realty that took place. This assignment was a 12 week story, more than half taking place across the desert area of northern Ethiopia, and southern Djibouti. We had to carry supplies such as food, more than 100 liters of diesel and our most precious commodity, water. We felt we could find water so we carried on the roof of the land cruiser around 50 liters. Within a week we had gone through nearly half for cooking, making coffee, and basic bathing every few days. Not finding potable water nor any relatively clean water anywhere, at that point I realized something had to be done - no more bathing...we were down to our last ten liters which was needed for drinking and brushing teeth. Was rather interesting After more than a week, I began to notice my skin naturally cleansing itself, pushing away dirt stains by sweating through the pores of skin - we were never designed to bathe as often as we do today. Also, only my clothes smelled unpleasant, but not body. My first access to a shower was three weeks later on a brief return visit to Addis Ababa to pick up supplies. These portraits are the just before and after showering at the first hotel in more than a month. What I remember most was the hotel staff giggling upon check in, thinking I came wandering in from the desert. And of course, I had.\n-\nAfter your kind reaction to yesterday’s selfie photo, I thought to continue for a bit in a series of self portraits from various assignments over the years with National Geographic, Time magazine and other publications. This gives me time as I prepare over the coming days for another assignment that begins soon in Brazil with @rippleeffectimages on a project for NatGeo Learning/Cengage.
