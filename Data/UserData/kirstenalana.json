So I was glad @dante.vincent was game for a weekend visit to Descanso Gardens which we had previously visited in December for their nighttime light show. It has themed gardens where landscape architecture styles from around the world are on display for residents and visitors who pay the entrance fee. We paid ours in advance online, showed up early and were almost the first to walk in when it opened. I‚Äôd advise this if you want to see the gardens with less people. üå∏ Once we entered, we headed straight for the Japanese-style garden ‚Äî where I took this photo ‚Äî that [from @descansogardens website] ‚Äúblends design elements from four classic garden styles. Cross an arched bridge and walk on shaded paths along a koi-filled stream to the teahouse, designed by architect Whitney Smith and built in 1966. The plants in this garden are all native to Asia, and include camellias, azaleas, mondo grass and Japanese maples. The distinctive roof of the teahouse, crafted from blue tiles imported from Japan, is especially striking in the spring when nearby pink cherry and plum trees are in bloom. The garden includes a minka, modeled after a traditional farmhouse, which was designed by Kenneth Masao Nishimoto and built in 1969.‚Äù As we weren‚Äôt able to travel to Japan this Spring like we‚Äôd hoped to do and since a similar area in the Brooklyn Botanic Garden was always our favorite in New York, this part of Descanso ended up being our favorite at this time of year. It felt the most different from where we live near Runyon Canyon, which is more arid, punctuated by palm trees, cactus and succulents and which doesn‚Äôt really have anything blooming except the plants on our balcony. (Not complaining. Just drawing a contrast.) Does this sound like somewhere you‚Äôd want to visit when you travel to Los Angeles?\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#descansogardens #exploredescanso #sakura #cherryblossoms #japanesegarden #discoverLA #LAstory #visitcalifornia #restinnature #LaCa√±adaFlintridge #BeniHoshi", "shortcode": "BwW46xwhLF_", "edge_media_to_comment": 126, "comments_disabled": false, "taken_at_timestamp": 1555506229, "dimensions": {"height": 1349, "width": 1080}, "display_url": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/952a5876e00c61b7de8bde4480df133a/5D77FF3D/t51.2885-15/e35/56191698_465048404234039_5352536744437667572_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "edge_liked_by": 2070, "edge_media_preview_like": 2070, "location": "Descanso Gardens", "gating_info": null, "media_preview": "ACEqht5DEoIAPrk9v8auXEyR/wCqHzn+Ic/XHaslAwwRx2NXBH5a7y23I4AwSee386XMxWRIBvYtyWA5OehzwPx5/Oq8luSDwcjGcdT9B/kVatZyrHdg7sYz3x2/mauXxXYVGd2MqD/P/wDXSvcZzflj0P5Cijyz6j8qKYFuFgOM4H1/zxVz7OrHuc+n/wBfp61kK7oeg9R6/nUguJQTg8n/ADxUtIvc1hHGjgnsRjnofTmm30rKCzc54Hpz/nNVJLlth/vAgkn/AD/nrUM115sgJOUQ5APr/WgQeWP9r8qKX7a3+f8A9dFMWg2Ihl2N1PIxyRWhHaCTkn3yD/n9elZFr1H+fSrczFVIBwCecd+KQyQ2qMTHCSV/iY8jPoMcn+X4VQe1KuY3OCenHU//AF60FJWNccfSor45jQnk8896EBW+yn3/ACoqPzG9T+ZopiP/2Q==", "owner": {"id": "116480", "username": "kirstenalana"}, "thumbnail_src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/5b594390224f0ddf4a57943178886259/5D363F96/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.134.1080.1080/s640x640/56191698_465048404234039_5352536744437667572_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "thumbnail_resources": [{"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/4d5b71ffe03f9702e794b9d2ee17387d/5D54C18D/t51.2885-15/e35/c0.134.1080.1080/s150x150/56191698_465048404234039_5352536744437667572_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 150, "config_height": 150}, {"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/999e92217bd7f549aba0bf0a5d7fd187/5D53D5C7/t51.2885-15/e35/c0.134.1080.1080/s240x240/56191698_465048404234039_5352536744437667572_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 240, "config_height": 240}, {"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/37c40541872372558415583e5c0e5500/5D3F4A7D/t51.2885-15/e35/c0.134.1080.1080/s320x320/56191698_465048404234039_5352536744437667572_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 320, "config_height": 320}, {"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/08ac221fbebf8547b2647c18ba964333/5D365127/t51.2885-15/e35/c0.134.1080.1080/s480x480/56191698_465048404234039_5352536744437667572_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 480, "config_height": 480}, {"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/5b594390224f0ddf4a57943178886259/5D363F96/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.134.1080.1080/s640x640/56191698_465048404234039_5352536744437667572_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 640, "config_height": 640}], "is_video": false, "accessibility_caption": "Image may contain: 1 person, tree, plant, bridge, sky, outdoor and nature"}, {"__typename": "GraphVideo", "id": "2022818612532058531", "edge_media_to_caption": "feeling sad for all of the people who will never again see Notre-Dame, looking like this and profoundly grateful for all the times I saw it... while also heart broken at how much I took for granted that it would just always be there for me to see every time I returned to Paris\n.\ntoday‚Äôs fire is a representation of how fragile this existence is -

There‚Äôs just something about Island life! üå¥‚òÄÔ∏èüåä\n.\n.\n#voyagersincatalina #visitcatalina #visitcatalinaisland #wrigleycentennial #visitcalifornia #catalinaisland", "shortcode": "BwKAqsZhePI", "edge_media_to_comment": 83, "comments_disabled": false, "taken_at_timestamp": 1555074084, "dimensions": {"height": 1349, "width": 1080}, "display_url": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/835efcd6e290ff82c889b070edf3a66f/5D3CFDBE/t51.2885-15/e35/56742836_176387070016220_2958412574728497818_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "edge_liked_by": 1349, "edge_media_preview_like": 1349, "location": "Catalina Island", "gating_info": null, "media_preview": "ACEqtqzr0OKlWd/rTQlSKuOnFdDt2MFfuW1OaQkCq22m4OfWs+U1uWd49aKhx7CiiwXMwXrev4YpTdsw5YL9ODWcfXJb8xUxEffBPoCcj/P86z17jsBnkJwXYj15/wA/0pjOM/KzZ+pqRdq/dYgdx/n/ABpREXzjnPr6/SnqIq5P979aKm8t/UflRTsxaFkH6fX/AOtj+tOAU9QP0/WohTq1ZmmPwD2H5CjC7em4+nAxz165NMo7VNirj9w9BRUVFFguf//Z", "owner": {"id": "116480", "username": "kirstenalana"}, "thumbnail_src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/7d48d5aacb62457411556fb7d50865d4/5D536C15/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.134.1080.1080/s640x640/56742836_176387070016220_2958412574728497818_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "thumbnail_resources": [{"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/f529085dbd337aaeafdd1842e90c3f06/5D3D990E/t51.2885-15/e35/c0.134.1080.1080/s150x150/56742836_176387070016220_2958412574728497818_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 150, "config_height": 150}, {"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/bbee3ded85eb57e1bf600781fb034f84/5D43F544/t51.2885-15/e35/c0.134.1080.1080/s240x240/56742836_176387070016220_2958412574728497818_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 240, "config_height": 240}, {"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/05b99f50c1dd0e2a1457191cb0f543db/5D7760FE/t51.2885-15/e35/c0.134.1080.1080/s320x320/56742836_176387070016220_2958412574728497818_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 320, "config_height": 320}, {"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/26963cc99861f477944a0a93f74137f1/5D53E5A4/t51.2885-15/e35/c0.134.1080.1080/s480x480/56742836_176387070016220_2958412574728497818_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 480, "config_height": 480}, {"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/7d48d5aacb62457411556fb7d50865d4/5D536C15/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.134.1080.1080/s640x640/56742836_176387070016220_2958412574728497818_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 640, "config_height": 640}], "is_video": false, "accessibility_caption": "Image may contain: mountain, sky, cloud, outdoor, nature and water"}, {"__typename": "GraphImage", "id": "2018998815226699544", "edge_media_to_caption": "Did you know that the word ‚Äòcasino‚Äô does not actually denote a place of gambling? Or at least it didn‚Äôt until quite recently. When Catalina Island‚Äôs Casino was commissioned by William Wrigley Jr, the word in Italian simply denoted a place of gathering, a meeting place for entertainment and dancing. Wrigley intended it to be THE place for entertainment and dancing on Catalina Island. And it was! Benny Goodman earned his reputation as the ‚ÄúKing of Swing‚Äù in the massive top floor ballroom which is surrounded by the columned portico in this photo that offers 365 degree photos of Catalina Island, the town of Avalon and the Bay. Cecile B. DeMille once screened his latest films in the Wrigley‚Äôs private viewing room at the Casino. The green rooms hosted Errol Flynn, Cary Grant and more. Even now, the Avalon Theatre on the ground floor still shows first-run movies nightly at 7:30 p.m. and while the latest tech plays those movies now, the projection rooms still house the original state-of-the-art equipment that was installed in the early 1900‚Äôs to usher in the era of talking pictures under a ceiling of the most stunning Art Deco murals completed by John Gabriel Beckman. 24 karat gold stars add to the feeling of Hollywood glamour that still seems to infuse the whole building but they‚Äôre mere icing on the cake when you consider all the history the Casino has been a part of since it was completed on May 29, 1929. It was then, and still is, one of the most important buildings on Catalina Island & I really enjoyed learning about it through my hosted ‚ÄòBehind the Scenes‚Äô tour with @visitcatalinaisland. 90 minutes flew by way too fast for me and I was glad I‚Äôd opted for the longer tour over the 45 minute version. I could have lingered up here for 90 minutes alone. From where I took this photo, I could even see bright orange Garibaldi fish swimming in the deep teal waters of the Bay and a lone seal poked its head out as if to say ‚Äúhello üëãüèº‚Äù. 2019 marks 100 years since Wrigley fell in love with the island ended up investing in it, from up here, it was so easy to see why.

Both are bookable via their web site.\n.\nThe first, represented by the first photo in this carousel, is Mt. Ada. The former home of William Wrigley Jr. and his wife when they were on the island in the 1900s, it receives the first light each day and the last. I think it has the best view on the island and room reservations come with an embarrassment of riches in terms of added amenities such as a complimentary golf cart for the duration of your stay (normally $50/hr), complimentary golf at the island‚Äôs course, a credit at the island‚Äôs spa, in town dining credit, a 24 hour complimentary Butler‚Äôs Pantry with alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages as well as snacks, two meals a day and so much more. It is a @forbestravelguide award winner and a true gem of a property that I‚Äôll be booking for a special occasion trip to Catalina if I have my way.\n.\nRight in town, less than 100 steps from the beach, is The Pavilion Hotel, represented by the second photo of what looks like a tropical oasis. This motel-style property, meaning you enter the rooms from outside, is laid out a lush garden. It has a fire pit for maximum warmth factor on those cold nights when you still want to hang out with the friends you travel with as well as nightly wine & cheese hour complimentary for all guests. I had conversations with quite a few staff members and watched them always treat guests with the utmost kindness. It‚Äôs a very friendly property with a location ideal for those who want to be right in the heart of it all.\n.\nAnd they‚Äôre both just a short ferry ride away from Los Angeles on the @catalinaexpress. Thank you @catalinachamber for hosting the #voyagersincatalina together with the above named entities this week. As always, and particularly when I‚Äôm not paid, all opinions are my own!\n.\n.\n.\n#visitcatalinaisland #catalinaisland #visitcatalina #visitcalifornia #santacatalinaisland #catalinaislandcompany #wheretostay #forbestravelguide #catalinaislandview #travelguides #wrigleycentennial", "shortcode": "Bv6nenjBAnA", "edge_media_to_comment": 75, "comments_disabled": false, "taken_at_timestamp": 1554557561, "dimensions": {"height": 1349, "width": 1080}, "display_url": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/df39f64f877ad8a2dacfa3228ff3b1e3/5D5615FF/t51.2885-15/e35/53804612_407880799772703_7884323593578199336_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "edge_liked_by": 1340, "edge_media_preview_like": 1340, "location": "Mt.

One of the Channel Islands! They are like a long string of irregularly shaped pearls laying off the coast of California varying in size and differing greatly in terms of development or lack thereof. It‚Äôs difficult to say which is the most well known since it depends on who you ask I think. But it‚Äôs Catalina Island, once known as Santa Catalina, that I spent time on this week at the invitation of @catalinaexpress, the @catalinachamber & @visitcatalinaisland on a press trip put together by my friend @kelleyferro to celebrate the #wrigleycentennial which is 100 years since William Wrigley Jr. fell in love with the island and purchased a controlling interest in what is now the Catalina Island Company.\n.\nThrough a variety of hosted experiences and a tiny bit of free time, I enjoyed discovering the incredibly rich history of an island that has less than five thousand full time residents and less than 900 full size cars. The primary mode of transportation on Catalina is golf cart or electric smart car and it was on a self-guided golf cart tour that I discovered this home to the immediate thumping of my heart. I was in love. Turquoise is basically my favorite color ‚Äî as it always reminds me of the ocean ‚Äî and I loved it against the white in a style that was so reminiscent of my beloved Europe. This looks like a fusion of places I‚Äôve seen in Spain, Italy and France. All of which seem to be present on the island in one form or another. So while my heart sometimes mourns being farther away from those countries now that I live in LA instead of NYC, this week, the longing was lessened by Catalina‚Äôs sublime charms. That charm and so many stories to come all this week. Can‚Äôt wait to share!\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#visitcatalina #visitcatalinaisland #visitcalifornia #catalinaisland #santacatalina #europeanvibes #houseportraits #voyagersincatalina", "shortcode": "Bv3-SqjBIg2", "edge_media_to_comment": 113, "comments_disabled": false, "taken_at_timestamp": 1554468859, "dimensions": {"height": 1349, "width": 1080}, "display_url": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/c83a783b78340b683ab19988a2a7a359/5D2FB72E/t51.2885-15/e35/54248168_661867047582854_5441943201286779452_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "edge_liked_by": 2171, "edge_media_preview_like": 2171, "location": "Catalina Island", "gating_info": null, "media_preview": "ACEqpvBIfnf5QylsnGfl47468YHeppEyqHPzFQowQB7Z4HbIxyf6l3P9oIGSAqgZ9fXjArRjsVZhI/Tgj8upzxz6UgMMRuw3Dp6nj2/Q/lWq+nOQELfLjv2IHT3HJ6GrMiAfu1OVThhjCjJDDOO49Rx6gE0+6uPK2nj5/UHnp+X607AZn9lP/eX9f8KK3cUUAcrGwAwfmyOO2D/X61uJKZWVAONuf++cf5H0rnRznHHGfrWwtyLUFQpLKOTntjJwPx+tIC+E/eSFvlUlSD6kf59KJ4Y7gKWPCnKnOOf8ism5MrjzRuU5UYPQ5Hb/ADirN4mYBHkZXax/XtTA1M0Vjf2gv+1+VFAXLQVCMlFOe/Q49OO3tUJtfNYkttDdR36Yx75/Opo+VH0H8qfQMge2lYbN25c5GcjoOx5x/niopQ+9VI3fdDHqO4/l/wDXq4CQafKABxxRcLEv2K3/ALi/lRUW4+pooEf/2Q==", "owner": {"id": "116480", "username": "kirstenalana"}, "thumbnail_src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/4cf3b56e8f4e6238b28d623d1f2da175/5D480E85/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.134.1080.1080/s640x640/54248168_661867047582854_5441943201286779452_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "thumbnail_resources": [{"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/4bd48f1f52e88a5647e8d387b9477d94/5D30629E/t51.2885-15/e35/c0.134.1080.1080/s150x150/54248168_661867047582854_5441943201286779452_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 150, "config_height": 150}, {"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/25f7be59740a6c77806e8fff8c1c5b4f/5D351AD4/t51.2885-15/e35/c0.134.1080.1080/s240x240/54248168_661867047582854_5441943201286779452_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 240, "config_height": 240}, {"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/960760d8ee87f5ec6dd13d39ab6cc840/5D341C6E/t51.2885-15/e35/c0.134.1080.1080/s320x320/54248168_661867047582854_5441943201286779452_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 320, "config_height": 320}, {"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/9c3ec37e758c247d03b1d2f874e2b7fe/5D388234/t51.2885-15/e35/c0.134.1080.1080/s480x480/54248168_661867047582854_5441943201286779452_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 480, "config_height": 480}, {"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/4cf3b56e8f4e6238b28d623d1f2da175/5D480E85/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.134.1080.1080/s640x640/54248168_661867047582854_5441943201286779452_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 640, "config_height": 640}], "is_video": false, "accessibility_caption": "Image may contain: house, tree, plant, sky and outdoor"}, {"__typename": "GraphImage", "id": "2012457631591297196", "edge_media_to_caption": "This week I‚Äôll be posting all about California, starting with our weekend visit to Point Dume in Malibu and ending with a trip to one of the islands off the coast that I‚Äôll be experiencing for the first time alongside some friends who used to live in New York as well! I‚Äôm excited to have so many stories to share about my now home state because in case you couldn‚Äôt tell from my previous posts over the last 10 months of living here - I really love it!\n.\nPoint Dume is a spot @dante.vincent & I have visited before but this time instead of just laying out on the beach for a while and then doing a part of the hike on the bluffs, we actually spend a long time above the beach on the trails and looking out at the water where we spotted a pod of dolphins and saw many of the resident seals that call the area home. The weather was absolutely beautiful, not too warm and not too cold. And since California had such a wet winter, the bluffs were super in bloom (haha get it ‚Äúsuperbloom‚Äù üòâ) with all kinds of flowers and flowering plants. I even saw a few of the state‚Äôs signature poppies. It looked beautiful, the mostly yellow carpet of flowers that stood out so well against the blue of the sky and water. I could have pitched a tent and stayed for days and not felt bored. Alas, there‚Äôs no camping at Point Dume. But there are very well-marked sandy trails and eventually even a boardwalk and lookout spots on the bluffs making it easy to explore the area while ensuring you protect the natural life there.\n.\nI‚Äôm becoming more and more sensitive to how often people disregard rules and go off the paths and just like I‚Äôve seen in other spots in California - there were a lot of people doing that when we visited. That‚Äôs not something I support but I can assure you that even staying on the marked trails still provides a beautiful experience. The park is open sunrise to sunset and parking is $8.\n.\n#visitcalifornia #californiawild #pointdume #leavenotrace #castateparks #explorecalifornia #caliexplored #californiasuperbloom", "shortcode": "Bvtr42whfCs", "edge_media_to_comment": 77, "comments_disabled": false, "taken_at_timestamp": 1554123666, "dimensions": {"height": 1349, "width": 1080}, "display_url": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/6061a82659f8c344fa32cf827da4ecb1/5D33F3CA/t51.2885-15/e35/54447241_369378453662131_7586119549265518590_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "edge_liked_by": 1288, "edge_media_preview_like": 1288, "location": "Point Dume, Malibu", "gating_info": null, "media_preview": "ACEqt7aXyiatYxTS4HoK2uY2IBCe9PEeO1MluFjGSc5OOKj+1J0Ylecc9/elcZZ2Ciqv2mH+8tFL5j+RCvzHBf8AUmnHy06lm/QVSE2cbcAHj3oikBfuT69h+Fc7nItRiTyES4CjaOx/i/M9OPaq/wBmX+Ln6k1OXx97Hr71AJYy2OelZ80n3LskL9lj9P50U/5PVvzNFK77sehRCgtxwPz/AJ1ZhwoJBBJP6/0queg/Ghfun/PetmrkbExCtknI7f1pggXPJz7c/wBKaeVX8P60rdKVtNxlny4vQ/n/APXoqjRUcvmxn//Z", "owner": {"id": "116480", "username": "kirstenalana"}, "thumbnail_src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/44c89af2265872ace8b36d8833ba006c/5D484361/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.134.1080.1080/s640x640/54447241_369378453662131_7586119549265518590_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "thumbnail_resources": [{"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/b800c38f6d04dc418688aa4ac942ce91/5D47317A/t51.2885-15/e35/c0.134.1080.1080/s150x150/54447241_369378453662131_7586119549265518590_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 150, "config_height": 150}, {"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/cec452937709720dd104f0fba384d693/5D439C30/t51.2885-15/e35/c0.134.1080.1080/s240x240/54447241_369378453662131_7586119549265518590_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 240, "config_height": 240}, {"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/d2d2728fac179816b2304b3f9d86cb2b/5D46ED8A/t51.2885-15/e35/c0.134.1080.1080/s320x320/54447241_369378453662131_7586119549265518590_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 320, "config_height": 320}, {"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/1b42d1d1fe2ded4599a4fe5a2d6adcec/5D3B94D0/t51.2885-15/e35/c0.134.1080.1080/s480x480/54447241_369378453662131_7586119549265518590_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 480, "config_height": 480}, {"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/44c89af2265872ace8b36d8833ba006c/5D484361/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.134.1080.1080/s640x640/54447241_369378453662131_7586119549265518590_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 640, "config_height": 640}], "is_video": false, "accessibility_caption": "Image may contain: ocean, sky, cloud, plant, tree, outdoor, nature and water"}, {"__typename": "GraphImage", "id": "2007384231143339770", "edge_media_to_caption": "T-minus 1 month till I land in Dublin and I cannot wait to be back in Ireland, this time, to explore the country outside the city itself since that‚Äôs all I saw last time.

After @dante.vincent so sweetly drove me the 5 + hours round trip that it takes to get to/from Walker Canyon from where we live in Los Angeles to see the largest wildflower event in the state because he knows how much I love flowers and how much just seeing them makes me happy ‚Äî I spent days pondering the question of whether my posting about it would help or further hurt the delicately balanced ecosystem that is the superbloom. I saw so many people walking on, laying on, pulling from the ground and trampling flowers just for their photos & it caused me to wonder, ‚ÄúEven if I am doing the right thing by staying on the trail and not even touching any flowers, will it still somehow inadvertently spread the wrong message just by posting about this at all?!‚Äù Well I still don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm pushing publish on this post in the hopes that by sharing this photo that I managed to take without damaging any poppies, it will help spread awareness about how we all ‚Äî myself included ‚Äî need to constantly think about preserving and protecting nature, not just appreciating it. While it would have always been out of character for me to lay down in flowers and make myself the focus of the moment, in truth even I didn‚Äôt know how delicate the superbloom ecosystem is until I did research about how and when to experience it. It‚Äôs very delicate! Interacting with the blooms in almost any way can cause them never to return or regrow in the future. Meaning we can literally love the superbloom to death if we don‚Äôt just enjoy it from a distance. The Center for Outdoor Ethics, aka ‚ÄòLeave No Trace, as well as Casey Schreiner and Grown in L.A. advise that you follow these guidelines: Don‚Äôt go off-trail, Leave the flowers as you found them, Don‚Äôt damage any other trails or habitat to get your images and Share this philosophy in the text of your photo. If we all follow those guidelines, there should be no controversy and the wild flowers that make California so beautiful will always be there for all of us to enjoy each Spring. üß° #leavenotrace #californiapoppies #walkercanyon #poppyfields", "shortcode": "BvT8DlTBjm7", "edge_media_to_comment": 166, "comments_disabled": false, "taken_at_timestamp": 1553259727, "dimensions": {"height": 1349, "width": 1080}, "display_url": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/a5206bf99158d07cd985ecd7f26eade6/5D3A1B7E/t51.2885-15/e35/53255489_1989675504476789_4989288797633790645_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "edge_liked_by": 2271, "edge_media_preview_like": 2271, "location": "Walker Canyon Poppy Fields", "gating_info": null, "media_preview": "ACEqiS5jYcZJ9Kcsx64H61lFeNw4qSOWQ8AbqHKW6YlGPY1fOX0NMM6+h/SoBlhzwaDj0NT7SRfs4k3np7/lRUHy+p/Kin7SXYn2ce5EqLjkVIrD6VAHAHv9Pb/Ipx2nnJBPUDoKya7mifa35ExORmmnniock9jt7/T60hKheCQwOOnX/wDVQkJ3eo7eKKrbjRWljOwtSCXjH8qgpy9RQ0Uh/Rev1FRs2TS9z+NR00NhRRRTJP/Z", "owner": {"id": "116480", "username": "kirstenalana"}, "thumbnail_src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/d8c91f7aa8085efd975ed5db52d1aa96/5D489C72/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.134.1080.1080/s640x640/53255489_1989675504476789_4989288797633790645_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "thumbnail_resources": [{"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/6524f65a973fe7f45e2e415334474ff6/5D47BFE5/t51.2885-15/e35/c0.134.1080.1080/s150x150/53255489_1989675504476789_4989288797633790645_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 150, "config_height": 150}, {"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/ecd1f7353507e694af79bdb269256bee/5D3E4CE3/t51.2885-15/e35/c0.134.1080.1080/s240x240/53255489_1989675504476789_4989288797633790645_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 240, "config_height": 240}, {"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/8132174ea928717238244681a5c25f92/5D362A9D/t51.2885-15/e35/c0.134.1080.1080/s320x320/53255489_1989675504476789_4989288797633790645_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 320, "config_height": 320}, {"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/574db90fa87997519df9eed764eb6423/5D38F7DA/t51.2885-15/e35/c0.134.1080.1080/s480x480/53255489_1989675504476789_4989288797633790645_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 480, "config_height": 480}, {"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/d8c91f7aa8085efd975ed5db52d1aa96/5D489C72/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.134.1080.1080/s640x640/53255489_1989675504476789_4989288797633790645_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 640, "config_height": 640}], "is_video": false, "accessibility_caption": "Image may contain: plant, sky, mountain, flower, outdoor and nature"}, {"__typename": "GraphImage", "id": "2003143524534717239", "edge_media_to_caption": "Spinning the globe on this #TravelTuesday to share this image from Lisbon, Portugal that I captured in 2017 while working in Europe as a staff member for a private jet journey. Two nights in Lisbon weren‚Äôt even close to long enough to satisfy my hunger for the city of tiled buildings and cobbled streets. I‚Äôve dreamt of returning ever since.\n.\nEspecially since our itinerary didn‚Äôt include seeing nearly as many of the famed tile buildings as I might have liked. I‚Äôve had a thing for decorative tile since long before it was trendy. And yet, at the same time, it was very me. The days we did spend in Lisboa. If you‚Äôve followed me for a long time then you know I don‚Äôt visit a place only to hit its highlights or its most famous landmarks. My thirst for travel is only sated by authentic interactions with locals, with the kind of meals that aren‚Äôt on a menu that‚Äôs in English AND in the native language and I don‚Äôt want to share the same photo of a place that you‚Äôve seen on 100 other Instagram feeds.\n.\nThe more I travel, the more I long for the moments no one else is sharing. As a photographer AND as a traveler, it‚Äôs those glimpses of a destination that I crave more than anything.\n.\nWhat about you?\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#lisboa #lisbonportugal #visitlisboa #visitportugal #iamatraveller #tcsworldtravel #traveldeeper #portugal_em_fotos #passionpassport #tlpicks #iamatraveler", "shortcode": "BvMmGwmBAs3", "edge_media_to_comment": 118, "comments_disabled": false, "taken_at_timestamp": 1553013338, "dimensions": {"height": 1350, "width": 1080}, "display_url": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/d06fecc0066d473af27492cf4ac55133/5D321854/t51.2885-15/e35/53382646_320294792004874_2940075009817589397_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "edge_liked_by": 1778, "edge_media_preview_like": 1778, "location": "CASTELO DE S.

Built in 1926 by William E. Brown, and rumored to have at one time belonged to Bette Midler, the 60-foot tower you see in this photo reaches from the edge of the water up to the top of the cliff to its accompanying private home built in the Norman-style. Inside the tower is a staircase for the owners to use for beach access. Popularly called ‚ÄòThe Pirate Tower‚Äô, which is a moniker it received from the second owner of the estate - retired naval captain Harold Kendrick - it‚Äôs accessible from Victoria Beach when the tide is low. @dante.vincent and I were there this weekend for sunset, when I shot this, and we didn‚Äôt have the spot to ourselves. It‚Äôs popular for engagement and maternity shoots but this time it had also drawn French photographer @timgrenard. (Nice to meet you, Tim!) Like so many  spots made popular online that draw a lot of people - who seem to care very little about the fact that the tower itself is part of private property and there are houses immediately above - making lots of noise and being disruptive, which is rude to the people who call this beach home. I even saw people trying to break into the locked gate or attempting to climb the tower. So as much as I want to continue to share beautiful places like this, I will always do so with the note that if you‚Äôre going to visit, please do so with respect for not only other people but also the environment itself and the owners of any place you visit. Don‚Äôt leave trash, don‚Äôt carve in rock or graffiti any surfaces. Don‚Äôt attempt to access private property. Take only pictures and leave only footprints!\n.\nShot handheld on my @SonyAlpha a7RII with the 35mm f/2.8 lens, ISO 100, f/20 @ 1/6 sec\n.\n.\n.\n#piratetower #lagunabeach #victoriabeach #visitcalifornia #mylagunabeach #orangecounty #sonyalphafemale #sonya7rii #atlasobscura", "shortcode": "BvJozohhrKg", "edge_media_to_comment": 99, "comments_disabled": false, "taken_at_timestamp": 1552914091, "dimensions": {"height": 1349, "width": 1080}, "display_url": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/fe6769854746ab7f6c1eee4b9b1bee47/5D5636EA/t51.2885-15/e35/53037425_150582435967248_5041610834140520068_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "edge_liked_by": 2040, "edge_media_preview_like": 2040, "location": "Pirate Tower, Victoria Beach", "gating_info": null, "media_preview": "ACEq1NlJsq1soKVdyLGbO4hAJ7kD8+5rMuLnjavJ7sOPwFaWqJ+549RWTcREBSoJ+UZPvWcp62NIxVrlXaaKXyH9G/Kis7rui7eR3GKQ4HWuduZZXGV3frgepP8AnFRZuNnllQR1yByfqa01I0NDVpkEW0HJznjFQo6sCvcdPp0B/Dp7GsqZJnxlDgDHT/D/ADikxIowfkPPJ64PoD61lKPNuaJ2L32hPX/P5UVl+Un979P/AK9FTyR/pD5n/TLEjS3BKchQf7uPz9cdh1q6tzIh8uNCQoA+bj8Sf6Vs7FHQDp6VUl5U55rdO5k1YqNcyZDMo54G3JqGWIyNuYbvUnIP8z/IVct/8aiueFH1p2C5V8uL+6v5n/GinYFFKw7n/9k=", "owner": {"id": "116480", "username": "kirstenalana"}, "thumbnail_src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/64626b3e0430cfcf8f893d85b11acc89/5D3C1D72/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.134.1080.1080a/s640x640/53037425_150582435967248_5041610834140520068_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "thumbnail_resources": [{"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/159de4a78a1a3741d094975456fd40e3/5D3815B9/t51.2885-15/e35/c0.134.1080.1080a/s150x150/53037425_150582435967248_5041610834140520068_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 150, "config_height": 150}, {"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/529fa43a0b479b534a090e1fec06c315/5D75C4F3/t51.2885-15/e35/c0.134.1080.1080a/s240x240/53037425_150582435967248_5041610834140520068_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 240, "config_height": 240}, {"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/8f9359dca9fc4fdfa65d3d2325a046f2/5D770B49/t51.2885-15/e35/c0.134.1080.1080a/s320x320/53037425_150582435967248_5041610834140520068_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 320, "config_height": 320}, {"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/729e0f916d2940733c5e779a4b3eb5b1/5D339A13/t51.2885-15/e35/c0.134.1080.1080a/s480x480/53037425_150582435967248_5041610834140520068_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 480, "config_height": 480}, {"src": "https://instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/64626b3e0430cfcf8f893d85b11acc89/5D3C1D72/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.134.1080.1080a/s640x640/53037425_150582435967248_5041610834140520068_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fftw1-1.fna.fbcdn.net", "config_width": 640, "config_height": 640}], "is_video": false, "accessibility_caption": "Image may contain: 1 person, sky, ocean, outdoor, water and nature"}]}
